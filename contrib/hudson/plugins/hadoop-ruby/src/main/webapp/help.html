    <p>
        Runs a Hadoop Ruby script (defaults to <tt>ruby</tt> interpreter) for building the project.
        The script will be run with the workspace as the current directory.
    </p>

    <p>
        The shell will be invoked with "-v" option. So all of the commands are printed before being executed,
        and the build is considered a failure if any of the commands exits with a non-zero exit code.
